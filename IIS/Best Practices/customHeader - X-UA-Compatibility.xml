<!-- This can be put in the header of every html page, however this will
     break validation (which is a shame!). So we can set this on the
     http header, which makes sense. The reason for setting this, is to
     instruction Internet Explorer to process pages using the latest 
     rendering engine, and not fall back into compatibility mode.

     The Chrome=1 part, also takes advantage of Google Frame in IE if
     Chrome has been installed on the clients system.

		 Having this HEADER is consider best practice on all new websites -->
